# Titanic-EDA
# ðŸš¢ Titanic EDA Project  

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Titanic dataset**, aiming to uncover key factors influencing passenger survival. Using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, the analysis includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and visualizing survival trends based on features like **gender, class, and age**. Findings reveal that **females had higher survival rates, first-class passengers had a better chance of survival, and younger individuals were more likely to survive**. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). To run this project, clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/AbdelruhmanAshraf/Titanic-EDA.git`, install dependencies with `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`, and execute the Jupyter Notebook (`task2.ipynb`). Future improvements may include **feature engineering and machine learning modeling for survival prediction**.
